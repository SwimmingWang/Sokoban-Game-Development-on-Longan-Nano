The followings are what I do in this project:

  -Use RISCV to create the splash screen.
  
  -Display player on screen and player can react to keyboard input.
  
  -There are static walls and moving walls on screen and remaining life will reduce by one if player hit the wall.
  
  -When the player life reaches negative, game over.
  
  -When the player passes through the space between a pair of walls (and did not die), the player score should be increased by one.
  
  -3 different difficulties are implemented so that it is possible to select one. The difficulty selection screen must contain all of the following key points: all possible difficulties; highlighting of the chosen option.
  
  -Sample player location once per frame, move the sampled points left, and connect adjacent point pairs, so that all points, as a whole, mimics a tail of the player.
  
  -Prevent the screen from blinking.
